# Wishlist App
Having an event where guests will bring gifts, but you don't want to pretend to like the gifts they've brought you? Look no further, our wishlist app is here to save the day!

Designed as a gift registry, you will be able to create a list of items that you would like for the event. You can then share the link to the list to your guests. Your guests can then choose to contribute a cash amount to an item on your wishlist, or simply purchase you the whole item as a gift. This comes in handy when you have big ticket items that would be useful for you to receive as a gift (eg. baby crib, car seat, etc. for a baby shower).

Together with their contribution, your guests will also be able to leave their well-wishes too. This makes it convenient for guests who are unable to attend your event, yet still would like to contribute a gift.
